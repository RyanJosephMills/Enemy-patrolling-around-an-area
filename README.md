# Enemy-patrolling-around-an-area

So the first thing that you will need to do in order to create an enemy patrol is create the two boundaries to where the enemy can walk so to do this you will need to create and empty object and call it patrol point 1 then click on the cube just above the transform section and these are called Gizmos once in there choose a gizmo that you like and what this will do is it will make the patrol points easy to see and easy to place around the map after that you can the duplicate that and then place them where ever you want the enemy character to walk from and to.
Now that you have done that you will now need to start doing some scripting to actually get the enemy to move around, so you will need to make a script and call it EnemyMovement and then open it up.
Once you are inside of the script you will need to create some variables the first one is a public Transform and this will help us figure out which direction the enemy is heading in then you need to put [] patrolPoints as the name, now you can go back inside of unity and attach this script to the enemy and now you can see inside of the inspector something called Patrol points now you will notice that these points are empty, so what you will need to do is put in the patrol points that we just made earlier.
Now that you have made that you will now need to actually make the character move, so to do this you will need to go back into the script and create a new variable which is a public float moveSpeed; which will help you control the speed of the enemy, another variable that you will need to make is a public int called patrolDestination; and this will monitor which patrol point is currently the destination the enemy is heading in.
Now that you have all that we can the go and delete the start function as we will not be needing it for this, and now we can go to the update section and create an if statement and inside the brackets you will need to put patrolDestination == 1 then in the curly brackets you will need to put transform.postion = Vector2.MoveTowards(transform.position , patrolPoints[1].position, moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime); so what this code will essentially do is move the character from wherever he spawn to patrol point 1 however once he gets to that point he will just sit there as we havenâ€™t told him what to do next, to do this you will need to create an if statement and inside the brackets put a Vector2.Distance(transform.postion, patrolPoints[1].postion) < .2f) then inside of the curly brackets you will need to put patrolDestination = 2; and essentially what this code is saying is that when the enemy character gets within the distance of .2 it will then turn around and start heading to the other patrol point, now what you can do is copy this whole bit of code and paste it underneath it and what you will need to do is change all the 1 to 2 and all the 2 to 1 and what this will do is it will do the same thing as the other code however it is from the other patrol point. The last thing that you will need to do is make sure inside of unity you add a movement speed otherwise the character will not move at all now that you have done this you should have a fully working enemy movement system
